# play-with-python

Here I will play with **Python** from ["Head First Python"](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfpython/book).



## here are the bullets points to remember.


1. Python comes with a built-in IDE called IDLE, which
lets you create, edit, and run your Python code—all
you need to do is type in your code, save it, and then
press F5.
2. IDLE interacts with the Python interpreter, which
automates the compile-link-run process for you. This
lets you concentrate on writing your code.
3. The interpreter runs your code (stored in a file) from
top to bottom, one line at a time. There is no notion of
a main() function/method in Python.
4. Python comes with a powerful standard library, which
provides access to lots of reusable modules (of which
datetime is just one example).
5. There is a collection of standard data structures
available to you when you're writing Python
programs. The list is one of them, and is very similar
in notion to an array.
6. The type of a variable does not need to be declared.
When you assign a value to a variable in Python, it
dynamically takes on the type of the data it refers to.
7. You make decisions with the if/elif/else
statement. The if, elif, and else keywords
precede blocks of code, which are known in the
Python world as “suites.”
8. It is easy to spot suites of code, as they are always
indented. Indentation is the only code grouping
mechanism provided by Python.
9. In addition to indentation, suites of code are also
preceded by a colon (:). This is a syntactical
requirement of the language.
